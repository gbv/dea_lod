        <p>Extract of Count Gollowin's{{p0277}} answer to the said Memorial dated <placeName
            key="g0001"
            ref="https://www.geonames.org/524894">Mosco</placeName> 5./16. May 1705</p>
        <p />
        <p>Concerning the Exportation of goods Customfree according to the Contract, althou this was
          allowed by the Czars especiall grace for the produce of the Tobacco, in hopes to increase
          that Trade for the advantage of both dominions ; yet since so many disorders were
          committed by the Company{{o0137}} and their factors, as renderd the Contract null, as well
          by their own not importing the full quantity stipulated in the Treaty, as by the abuses of
          their factors and retalers, who sold Circassian Tobacco instead of English ; and that by
          such unwarantable practices their Treaty was entirely broke, the Czar{{p0174}} did not
          think convenient to make good the gace he had promisd them, for by the Treaty itself, it
          was not agreed, that the goods should be exported without any dutys at all, but only on
          paying the moderate and usuall Customs as the Envoy himself may plainly see out of the
          original English Contract.</p>
        <pb n="f. 90" />
        <p> What concerns the Letter of Exchange, which Mr. Goodfellow{{p1252}} gave for 20 m.
          Dollars, he was not constraind to it, but he did it for his free will, because several
          Commodities had been taken of him, as part of the Tobacco duties at very high rates,
          several other andvantages had been also allowed to the Company{{o0137}} and to the
          Consul{{p1252}} himself in particular ; as the giving of Podwodes or free carridges for
          the Tobacco, and such like helps as were not stipulated in the Treaty. All which might
          have more than made good the little advantage of this bill of Exchange ; the said bill lay
          also above a year and a half unpayd, and the money was taken up at great loss, and these R
          Dollars have been plac’d to his account instead of Russian money due for Customs at a
          reasonable price ; and not at an underate.</p>
        <p>What relates to the Contract for flax ; this does not in the least concern the
          Company{{o0137}}, but was given to the Consul{{p1252}} himself as a particular mark of the
          Czars favour, to encourage him in a Commerce on the East Sea, whereof the Consul{{p1252}}
          gave some hopes ; as to the duty thereof, it was order’d to be taken accordingly to the
          usuall Customs, which were pay’d by all Merchants, and not according to the new
          impositions laid on that commodity. Notwithstanding which several </p>
        <pb n="f. 90v" />
        <p> particular favours beyond what was agreed to in the first Traety, all has been to no
          purpose.</p>
