        <p>May it please your Excellency</p>
        <p>I have heard it often reported here at <placeName
            key="g0003"
            ref="https://www.geonames.org/2643743">London</placeName>, that one of the undertakings of the late <persName

            ref="18dcae56-9273-4ff4-add5-3bc8328d0da2">Emperor of Russia</persName> in respect of Trade, was to have searched for a passage to India by the North part of Tartary and that there were several schems [=schemes] to that purpose put in execution, the truth of which and what success they met with, your Excellency best knows: But believing it more immediately to concern the Russian Nation then [sic] any other, if there is such passage to have it discovered I thought it requisite to acquaint your Excellency that on very mature consideration I find that such an undertaking may be wholly performed by shipping and the Lands about the North Pole by the Same means </p>
        <pb n="f. 173v" />
        <p> fully discovered. It would be nedless [sic] to trouble your Excellency with the reasons that confirm me in this opinion, or with those that support the conjecture of such a passage till I can learn how acceptable such an undertaking may be at this juncture.</p>
        <p>I presume at present that it is sufficient only to observe that notwithstanding the severities of those cold regions and the many difficulties otherwise that attend that Navigation, yeat [=yet] is it very practicable likewise the industry of former adventurers, have now reduced the inquiry to a very narrow compass, so that in a very little time it might be ascertained whether is such passage or not. If your Excellency should think any thing I can propose in this affair woth [=worth] further inquiry, I am very ready at any Time under proper regulations to show how this may be effected, and on having the methods I should propose to that end entirely complied with, would undertake to put them in execution, not doubting but to give a satisfactory account should I proceed on such an undertaking. I must beg, this proposal may be forgot in case it is not approved, on consideration that it was my Dury to your Excellency that chiefly occasioned it. I am etc.</p>
