        <p>Extract of the memorial from Mr. Whitworth{{p1255}} to Count Gollowin{{p0277}}, in behalf
          of the English Merchants dated <placeName
            key="g0001"

          1705</p>
        <p>The Tobacco Company{{o0137}} was allowed by vertue of their Contract to empty the proceed
          of their Tobacco in such goods and Merchandises none excepted, as they should think fit,
          without paying any higher duty than other forreign Merchants then did, nevertheless the
          most and best Russian Commodities were given away to private persons, and the Company
          debarr’d from trading with them directly contrary to the words of the Contract. The
          Exportation Customfree was indeed allowed the 2. first years, and the due orders given for
          it, but they were recall’d in the year 1703. and Custom demanded, not only for what they
          should hereafter export, but also for what they had allready shipt out.</p>
        <p>In the year 1702. The English Consul Mr. Goodfellow{{p1252}} gave a bill of Exchange for
          20 m. Dollars for which he was immediately to have received ready money, which was not
          however performed but was plac’d to his account for the Custom of Tobacco, which dutys
          were agreed to be payd in the current coyn of this Country.</p>
        <p>In the same year Mr. Goodfellow{{p1252}} had made a Contract for exporting of hemp for
          five years, </p>
        <pb n="f. 89v" />
        <p> paying a certain duty ; but before two years were ended a new Importation of 10. pro
          cent was unexpectedly laid, and requir’d, not onely for considerable quantity of hemp,
          which he had allready bought up before the said prohibition, but for part of what he had
          actually shipt out of the Country.</p>
